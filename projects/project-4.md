[Cluhbs](http://cluhbs.meteorapp.com/#/) is a meteor application developed as a directory for registered and unregistered clubs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This was a group project of four members with equal contributions to the end product.

For this project, my main contributions were to the landing page, club directory page and edit club page. I also contributed to the cluhbs github page.
