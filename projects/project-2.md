The Hub at Leeward Community College is an ICS Helpdesk managed by students, for students. It is designed as an internship for ICS students to gain practical work experience in the computer field by applying classroom knowledge and develop job skills.

At least two students were scheduled to work at a time with a manager on site. Students were required to use previous classroom knowledge to solve problems, provide advice and troubleshoot hardware, software, cloud and Wi-Fi concerns. The Hub functioned as a running business with a reception and workspaces that included common tools and diagnostic devices.

Through this experience, I have gained work experience in troubleshooting various devices and creating solutions to those errors, as well as improving my customer service skills and team building skills.
