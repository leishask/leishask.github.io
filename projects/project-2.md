The Hub at Leeward Community College is an ICS Helpdesk managed by students, for students. It is designed as an internship for ICS students to gain practical work experience in the computer field by applying classroom knowledge and develop job skills.

At least two students were scheduled to work at a time with a manager on site. Students were required to use previous classroom knowledge to solve problems, provide advice and troubleshoot hardware, software, cloud and Wi-Fi concerns. The Hub functioned as a running business with a reception and workspaces that included common tools and diagnostic devices. In addition, students were also required to complete 10 NetLab+ simulation labs (https://netlab1.leeward.hawaii.edu/) to practice troubleshooting typical obstacles.

For five hours every week of the Spring 2018 semester, I was in charge of customer intake, reception and troubleshooting thoughout my shift. When a customer comes in, there are several forms to fill out and an interview process to get an idea of what the problem is. Depending on the severity of the issue, the device is either left at The Hub or the student can wait for the issue to be resolved. After intake, either the receptionist begins working on troubleshooting or the case is handed off to an available technician. The technician working on the device keeps documentation for other technicians to continue the troubleshooting process. When the problem is solved, the student is contacted and the device is picked up. Since The Hub is a learning operation, not all problems could be completely resolved.

Through this experience, I have gained work experience in troubleshooting various devices and creating solutions to those errors, as well as improving my customer service skills and team building skills. After working at The Hub, I gained more confidence in attempting both hardware and software troubleshooting.
