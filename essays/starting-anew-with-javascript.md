## Move Aside Java
The first programming language I learned was Java, followed by C/C++. While this is my first encounter with JavaScript, I found many similarities to Java and C/C++ as I completed the 106 Introduction to JavaScript lessons on freeCodeCamp.com. I am not going to lie though, I got a little ahead of myself thinking that there was not going to be a plot twist thrown in there somewhere. I was able to complete those lessons like nothing. However, the truth hit me as I began to read the JavaScript Style Guides, where I discovered that learning this new programming language was not going to be as easy as I thought.

## JavaScript is a Free Spirit
As a newbie to JavaScript, a couple things that stood out to me the most is declaring variables and arrays. To start off, in my comparison of JavaScript to Java and C/C++, JavaScript eliminates the procedure of shoving everything into a little box of rules. In my opinion, declaring variables is a basic necessity. So when JavaScript tosses out the use of declaring variables using data types such as int, double and string, it seems to somehow be quite reasonable and understandable. However, I am still getting familiar with the proper uses of var, let and const and the correct variable scopes. I am not done yet though. In JavaScript, you can throw different types of objects and data types into the same array. When I learned that arrays hold only one data type in Java and C/C++, it made sense then and now it makes sense in JavaScript that that rule no longer applies. I am already so fascinated with the vast possibilities that JavaScript offers and I look forward to learning more.

## Your Time Starts Now
Of course I cannot just praise the JavaScript Style Guides and freeCodeCamp.com for beginning my journey into learning JavaScript, I believe the pedagogy athletic software engineering plays a part as well. I personally found the practice WODs to be more thought provoking, which will provide me with numerous skills for a future career in computer science. I have become so used to spending hours coding a solution and debugging large programs, that I never noticed I was not being challenged enough to test my own capabilities. Yes, I could complete a successful program that does exactly what it is specified to do. However, I would have days to complete it and go through trial and error. So being provided a smaller problem with a limited amount of time to code a solution, could result in me becoming more comfortable and confident in honing my skills. I feel that this approach will produce quicker thinking and problem solving skills that I can utilize in future endeavors, and not just in computer science.
