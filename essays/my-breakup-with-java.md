## High School Sweethearts
Java was my high school sweetheart. The love was young and new. However, like young love, it was complicated and it always ends up being a learning process and life lesson. You learn from the relationship and eventually find "the one".

Java has given me the foundation and basics to create a lasting relationship with programming. It has taught me things that I will remember as I wade through my relationships with other programming languages. Such as primitive data types, classes, object oriented programming, functions, and more. All these lessons, with the time and frustration devoted to learn them, has shaped me into a more competent and patient programmer.

## Time to Move On
However, sometimes young love just can't hold up to the pressures of growing and changing while in a relationship. While it is possible to grow together better and stronger, this was not the case for me and Java. In fact, I have found a new love, Javascript.

## I'm with Javascript now
Java will always hold a special place in my college, and eventually professional, career. I owe a great devotion and gratitude to Java, but I have come to love another.

Javascript is more sophisticated and "grown up" compared to the complicated Java. Javascript likes to simplify and get right to the point. No more frustration trying to debug the relationship, no more late nights being confused about what is wrong or what can be done to make it easier. The arguments have become more productive and better to work through.

Instead of lines and lines of instructions and directions given to Java to complete a simple task, Javascript can complete the same task with just one line of instruction.

## Thank You Java
I will always be grateful for my first love, Java, but I have a new love now, Javascript. Thank you Java for the lessons that I will hold with me for life and throughout the rest of my programming relationships.
