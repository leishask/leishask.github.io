## Overview
The Problem: There is no system to provide a full class schedule preview and students cannot see and compare possible classes with time conflicts.

The Solution: An application for UH students that take in a course list to create possible class schedules that students can use for next semester registration.

## Mockup Page Ideas
- Landing Page
- Login Page
- User Home Page
- Class List Page
- Calendar Page
- Edit Page
- Finalized Calendar Page

## Use Case Ideas
- New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
- User goes to class list page and inputs courses
- System does automatic calendar preview on calendar Page
- User can go to edit page to edit the suggested schedules
- The finalized calendar page will show the final view of calendar

## Beyond the Basics
- Connect directly to STAR
- Save schedule suggestions for later
- Submit finalized calendar to registration
