## Put Your Mind to Work
Have you ever asked a question and received a wise remark instead of an answer? This could have been the result of you being uninformed of how to correctly ask well-developed questions that evoke useful answers, or an answer period. I witness students every day ask "bad questions" that could be answered by simply referring to the syllabus. Why would someone repeat information that has been discussed and is easily accessible? 
Always research and look through resources to find a solution to your problem or concern before consulting an expert. This will show that you made an effort. Plus, you may even find the answer to your question. The world is at our fingertips, yet we waste valuable time asking bad questions. When we start asking smarter questions that are thought-out, straightforward and clear, we can further our horizons.

## Bad Questions are a Thing of the Past
